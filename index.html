          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            The purpose of Sar-El is to enable supporters from around the world,
            and at home, to contribute to the security of the State of Israel by
            assisting on IDF bases in a logistical support role. By
            volunteering, participants not only help with essential tasks but
            also gain a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by Israel
            and its defense forces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sar-El Israel is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing
            humanitarian aid and support to communities affected by the
            Israel-Hamas conflict. Our mission is to promote peace,
            understanding, and cooperation through volunteer efforts and
            community engagement. We strive to foster a spirit of solidarity and
            mutual aid among people from diverse backgrounds, united by a common
            goal of supporting Israel.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sar-El's vision extends beyond immediate logistical support. We aim
            to build a global network of informed and engaged individuals who
            advocate for Israel's security and contribute to its societal
            resilience. By promoting volunteerism, we hope to inspire future
            generations to uphold the values of service, dedication, and
            international cooperation.
