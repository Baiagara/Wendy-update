            The Sar-El programs offer prospective volunteers an opportunity to
            live and work on IDF bases to gain an insider view of Israel.
            Volunteers work alongside soldiers, base employees, and other
            volunteers, performing non-combat support duties such as packing
            medical supplies, checking and repairing machinery and equipment; as
            well as cleaning, painting, and maintaining bases.
          </p>

          <p>
            We include cultural events, lectures and activities each evening
            while volunteers are on the base. Thursday afternoon through Sunday
            mornings are spent off the base. You can travel in Israel or visit
            with friends and/or relatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            We offer 1, 2 and 3-week programs that may be extended up to 6-weeks
            with prior permission.
          </p>

          <h4>SPECIAL PROGRAMS</h4>

          <p id="program-h4">Magen David Adom</p>
          <p>
            We have an exciting new partnership with Magen David Adom (MDA)!
            Embark on a transformative journey with ‘Ne’eman Chaim,’ an
            immersive first aid intensive brought to you by Sar-El in
            collaboration with Magen David Adom. This specialized program
            enhances your two-week Sar-El volunteering experience by providing
            20 hours of comprehensive first aid training, led by Magen David
            Adom experts. The training will be split into two afternoons a week,
            as well as an entire Thursday. Acquire essential skills to respond
            confidently to emergencies, and upon program completion, receive a

          <p id="program-h4">Lone Soldier Parents</p>
          <p>
            Another exciting specialty program on the horizon is our upcoming
            Lone Soldier Parent Group! Following the success of a recent group
            of parents who bravely followed in their children’s footsteps by
            volunteering with Sar-El in the IDF, we’ve decided to continue this
            meaningful initiative. These groups not only engage in volunteer
            work but also receive additional experiences designed to bring them
            closer to their lone soldiers. If you are a lone soldier parent or
            know someone who may be interested, please send them our way!

          weeks with a Sunday start day of your choosing. Please note we do not
          have volunteer programs during weeks with major Israeli and Jewish
          holidays. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us directly with
          questions.

            Sar-El volunteering takes place on IDF bases throughout the whole of
            Israel. The bases can be very hot in the summer and very cool on
            winter nights depending on location. The work of Sar-El is to assist
            Israel with the incredible burden placed on active and reserve
            citizen soldiers, therefore volunteer work will focus on logistical
            support.
          </p>
          <p>
            All volunteer groups are assigned an IDF team leader Madrich/a who
            will be present to assist volunteers with any issues.
          </p>
          <p id="program-h4">Arrival Day:</p>

          <p>
            We encourage volunteers to arrive to Israel 1-2 days prior to their
            volunteer period. Please keep in mind that all volunteers need to
            meet at the Terminal 3 Arrivals Hall of Ben Gurion airport on
            Sundays around 8:30am. Volunteers will need to check-in with their
            passports in hand. Volunteers will meet their Madrich/a (soldier
            instructor) and be assigned to their military base and have time to
            meet the rest of the volunteers in their unit. Please note, late
            arrivals will be required to arrange their own private
            transportation at their own expense if they miss their arrival time.
          </p>
          <p id="program-h4">Please remember the following:</p>
          <p>
            You will be given a uniform at the base. You will need to provide
            your own comfortable work shoes or sneakers. Your uniform must be
            worn while on base and while on duty.
          </p>
          <p id="program-h4">Volunteer Week:</p>
          <p>
            All volunteers are expected to follow the IDF schedule and be
            present for morning reveille as well as partake in morning and
            afternoon work sessions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that this is a sample itinerary and will vary according
            to the military base, the work demands and the season:
          </p>
          <li>8:15 Breakfast</li>
          <li>9:00 Flag Raising, Hatikvah and news/directives of the day</li>
          <li>9:30 Morning work session</li>
          <li>12:30 Lunch</li>
          <li>13:30 Afternoon work session</li>
          <li>18:00 Dinner</li>
          <li>19:00 Evening Programming</li>
          <p id="program-h4">Weekend:</p>
          <p>
            All bases close for the weekends so you volunteers will be released
            on Thursday afternoon (drop-off is at a major transportation hub in
            Tel Aviv) and will need to meet back at the airport on Sunday for
            the return to the base. Many volunteers take this time to tour the
            country or see friends. Accommodations, meals and transportation
            during this time are the responsibility of the volunteer.
          </p>
          <p id="program-h4">Departure Day:</p>
          <p>
            Please check with your Madrich/a on exact details of your departure
            time and drop-off location as this may vary from base to base.
          </p>
          <p id="program-h4">
            Remember that your volunteer service contributes to the security of
            Israel and we hope you have a meaningful experience. If any issue
            arises, please check-in with your Madrich/a for assistance.

        </div>

        <div class="health-textInoveled">
          <p>
            Sar-El’s Volunteer program is open to any participant who is a
            supporter of Israel, older than 16 and is in good physical and
            mental health. Please note that emergency medical insurance and a
            doctor’s sign-off is required for all participants. Health-care in
            Israel is at a high western standard, but many IDF army bases are in
            isolated areas with limited available medical care. Volunteers must
            reveal and limiting medical issue prior to participating in the
            program or risk being sent home if a pre-existing condition is not
            listed.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span id="program-h4">Fitness:</span>
            You should be on an exercise program as part of a daily routine, and
            comfortable with it before leaving for a Sar-El program. Assigned
            jobs on the base can include light or heavy lifting, or standing for
            long periods of time. Please expect to work for up to 8 hours a day
            of manual labor. You can take breaks, rest periods, and if
            necessary, discuss a more suitable job with the Madrich/a.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are on medications, check with your doctor before starting
            your exercise program. Particularly for older volunteers, the
            physical activity of the program, traveling, and changes in diet and
            climate may have serious consequences so please be sure to disclose
            all issues with Sar-El prior to arrival.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Sar-El’s sole discretion, a volunteer may be disqualified from
            the program at any point if physical or mental fitness is not up to
            IDF standards.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span id="program-h4">MMUNIZATIONS:</span>
            Israel does not currently require any immunizations for entering the
            country. It is wise to obtain an annual flu shot and a tetanus
            vaccine every ten years. A vaccination for pneumonia should be
            considered for volunteers 65 years and older, with chronic
            cardiopulmonary conditions and/or smokers. Vaccinations should be
            obtained at least 4-6 weeks before leaving for the program.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span id="program-h4">MEDICATIONS:</span>
            Keep prescription medications in original containers in carry-on
            luggage. Please include a list of all medications on your
            application. On most IDF bases volunteers do not have access to
            refrigerators and those that are available are not of a standard to
            store medications. Volunteers with any condition which requires
            refrigerated medication will not be able to join the program
          </p>

          <p>
            <span id="program-h4">HEALTH INSURANCE:</span>
            Inspire and build a new generation of volunteers while strengthening
            Jewish identity and connection to Israel among Diaspora teens and
            young adults who participate in the program
          </p>

          <p>
            <span id="program-h4">HEAT EXHAUSTION:</span>
            Israel has many hot days, and many of the job assignments require us
            to be outside. Drink plenty of water during the work period, wear a
            wide-brimmed hat, wear light-colored and loose fitting clothing and
            use sun screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Older adults are more vulnerable to heat because it takes more time
            to adjust to the changes. Volunteers on certain medications for
            cardiovascular conditions, medications for psychiatric conditions
            and medications for diabetes are at an increased risk for a
            heat-related illness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Check with your doctor to see if your health conditions will be
            affected by working outside in the sun. You may want to volunteer
            during a time of cooler weather in Israel and for a job where the
            volunteer can be inside a building.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span id="program-h4">DIABETES:</span>
            A number of volunteers who come to Israel have diabetes which is
            managed by diet and/or medications. The American Diabetes
            Association has an online site with information for diabetics who
            will be travelling. The volunteer should review this information.
            Before leaving for Israel see your doctor for a medical exam to make
            sure your diabetes is under control, and have a letter explaining
            what you need to do for your diabetes, and have a prescription for
            insulin and/or pills. Volunteers with diabetes should carry snacks
            and glucose tablets for emergency sugar sources at all times. The
            volunteer with diabetes requiring insulin should consider where
            diabetic supplies including insulin will be stored while on a Sar-El
            program. Insulin stored in very hot or very cold temperatures may
            lose its strength. Be sure to have more than enough diabetic
            medication in case of an emergency, and the diabetic volunteer
            should wear a medical ID bracelet or necklace that shows the
            volunteer has diabetes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since one will be on long flights, exposed to different activities,
            and have meals on IDF bases that may not fit your usual diabetic
            diet, test the blood sugar more often than usual.
