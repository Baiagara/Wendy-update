        <h3 class="purpose-Abouth3">What is the History of Sar-El?</h3>

        <p>
          In the summer of 1982, in the midst of the Galilee War, Golan Heights
          communities faced the disastrous prospect of losing their entire
          agricultural crop. The majority of able-bodied farmers and other
          workers were called up for army reserve duty and entire farms, with
          crops already ripened, were left unattended due to the acute manpower
          shortage.
        </p>
        <div class="history-Aboutp">
          <p>
            Dr. Aharon Davidi (z”l ), the former head of the IDF Paratrooper and
            Infantry Corps, was then Director of Community and Cultural
            Activities of the Golan and Jordan Valley. Touched by the farmers’
            distress, he sent friends as a recruitment team to the United
            States. Within a few weeks, some 650 volunteers arrived in Israel to
            lend their support through volunteer labor. Realizing the merits of
            that action, those first volunteers expressed their wish that the
            project be continued as an ongoing volunteer organization. As a
            result, in the Spring of 1983, Sar-El – The National Project for
            Volunteers for Israel, was founded as a non-profit, non-political
            organization (“Sar-El” is the Hebrew acronym meaning “Service for
            Israel”). Over the years, volunteers from other countries began to
            participate in the project, and to date, Sar-El is represented in
            over 30 countries worldwide.
          </p>

            alt="" />
        </div>
        <p id="history-Aboutp1">
          A number of its Jewish volunteers have since made “Aliyah” and have
          become Israeli citizens. Sar-El’s achievements over many years led to
          General Davidi being awarded the annual Moskowitz Prize for Zionism in
          2010.
        </p>
        <p id="history-Aboutp1">
          Since its inception from 1982 until today (May 2024) the Sar-El
          volunteer Project has brought in over 240,000 volunteers (40,000 since
          October 7, 2023 alone), providing broad logistical support to the IDF
          on bases throughout the country.

          </p>
          <p>
            2. To build a stronger link between the IDF and the Diaspora as well

          The goals of SAR-EL, outlined below, are our guiding organizational
          principles:
        </h3>
        <div class="goals-textAbout">
          <p>
            1. Create opportunities for Diaspora-based Jews and friends of
            Israel to make meaningful contributions to Israel, and in so doing,
            build friendships and connection with the Jewish people and our
            land.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Inspire and build a new generation of volunteers while
            strengthening Jewish identity and connection to Israel among
            Diaspora teens and young adults who participate in the program
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Provide quality logistical support to the Israel Defense Forces
            through the efforts of our strongly motivated volunteers from around
            the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Encourage program participants to organize, promote and
            participate in initiatives at home and abroad in support of the
            State of Israel
          </p>
          <p>
            5. Offer a realistic view of life in Israel and encourage the
            possibilities for Aliyah among Jewish participants
